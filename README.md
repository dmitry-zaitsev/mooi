# mooi

*mooi* is an AI language translator that:

- Is aware in what context the text is going to be used (thanks to GPT).
- Supports nearly every imaginable framework (Spring, Android, iOS, React, etc.).
- Only translates values that weren't translated already.

## How it Works

At a high level:

- Define your product copies in a `yaml` file
- Attach a description to each of your copies (just as you would do with a real translator).
- Configure in what format you would like your output to be.
- Run `mooi-cli` and get the result.
- Commit the changes.
